The evaluation function in the red-blue nim game is crucial for guiding the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent decisions and assess the game state's desirability. 
The evaluation function's purpose is to estimate the relative strength of the current game position, considering both the immediate board state and the expected outcome.

In the red-blue nim game, the primary goal is to either maximize your score (standard version) or minimize it (mis√®re version) by the end of the game, depending on the 
chosen version. The score is based on the number of marbles left, with different weights for red and blue marbles. Therefore, the reasoning behind the evaluation function 
is as follows:

1. Incorporating the Difference in Marbles.
2. Balancing Red and Blue Marbles.
3. Accounting for Endgame Conditions.
